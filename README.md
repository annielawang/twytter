## Description
Given the uncertainty regarding the the future of the popular social media platform Twitter, we decided to create a clone, whith which users can send posts, make comments on posts, and follow other users. Twytter is the perfect platform for users to come together to share and comment, therefore creating a fair, safe, civilized, and informative online community. 

This is a full-stack application using the following technologies:
- Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API
- Handlebars.js as the template engine.
- MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Passport for authentication
- Heroku
  
## Usage 
The user can
- sign up for their profile
- log in and log out
- create new posts and delete posts
- comment on other posts
- follow and unfollow other users
- browse profiles of followers
